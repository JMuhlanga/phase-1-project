                <p>Spice E-Sports was formed in 2022 by Dev-Knights & CO.The current gaming community in Kenya is more or less social and people with talent and can hack it in the E-sports scene are not getting the necessary recognition of their talents in gaming . This industry is also untapped for business who want to market their products and people who want to earn from their talents. </p>
                
                <p> We would like to bring together like minded individuals into a community of E-sports Gamers. E-sports can be a means to unite people and become a form of release after a long week of hard work . It can be a viable form of entertainment for people if only we can form various leagues based on the games and accompany them with the relevant rewards.</p>
                
                <p>Spice E-sports aims to creating an avenue to give this recognition to notable people and teams that have achieved at their various forms of e-sports while also getting details of people that want to join the scene and participate in the same.</p>
